 <p>Welcome to our MRI Repo! MRI is your very own private medical profile. MRI, short for Medical Records Instantly, aspires to provide a secure online environment for all your health records. MRI allows individuals to have all their medical test results, documents, and even insurance bills, stored in an easy to use database. Each individual is provided with a private login, that only they and their doctors may access. Through this login, hospitals and doctors are able to directly upload private test results, that you may then access anytime from anywhere in the world. Rather than having to wait weeks for records to arrive, MRI provides users automatic access to their medical history.
</p>

<p>Using location services, users are also able to search for clinics, medical services, and hospitals in the nearby area. MRI also lets users know which insurance is accepted at the aforementioned medical areas. Based on income and area, MRI also recommends which insurance is right for each user. Users are also able to make or cancel appointments upon their search. Users may also receive email and/or text reminders/alerts letting them know how often to take their prescribed medicines and when their next appointment is approaching.
</p>

<p>MRI will eventually allow documents, images, and even voicemails to be trasmitted via methods such as email, phone, fax, file upload, and more. Furthermore, doctors will be able to post personal health suggestions and comments if they so wish, in order to remind patients of their personal responsibility. MRI aims to close the gaps between doctor-patient relationships. MRI will effectively make the use of paper statements decrease, if not obselete, while beng able to provide patients with records in real time.
</p>

<p>MRI will also include a billing system, listing the price of each test and how much patients have to pay out of pocket. MRI hopes to provide ease to patients and families that are often very grief stricken and can not manage to keep track of all their medical bills.
</p>

<p> <h1>In short, MRI can be thought of as an online bank account, except that it details something much more important: your health. </h1> </p>
